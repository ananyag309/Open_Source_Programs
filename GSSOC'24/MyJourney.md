# My Journey - GSSOC'24

Hey there, What brings you here today? Are you curious about my journey, or perhaps seeking some inspiration to kickstart your own coding adventure? Whatever the reason, I'm genuinely excited to share my story with you. Let's embark on this journey together.


GSSoC i.e. GirlSricpt Summer of Code —it was the first open-source program I ever enrolled in. One day, while casually scrolling through LinkedIn, I stumbled upon a post announcing that applications were open for GSSoC. Being a freasher I was driven by curiosity and excitement to know about open source program as I have heard a lot from senior about it also seeing my fellowmates registering for it I too filled out the form on **April 21, 2024**. To my astonishment, just a few days later, on **April 30**, I received an email confirming my selection as a contributor. It felt like a dream come true.

Before this, I had never used GitHub and had no clue what participating in an open-source program entailed. Starting from scratch, the learning curve seemed daunting, but I was determined to figure things out. Despite my initial lack of knowledge, I ended up among the **top 25 contributors**—a testament to the power of **dedication and consistency**.

Armed with only basic frontend skills and some knowledge in Java, Python, and C++, the journey ahead appeared intimidating. Initially, I wasn’t entirely committed. The contribution phase kicked off on **May 10**, but my Semester 2 exams kept me preoccupied throughout May, limiting my participation.

Once my semester break began, I resolved to give it a sincere try. Being selected for GSSoC was a special opportunity, and I owed it to myself to make an effort. I've always believed in giving my best shot, regardless of the outcome. My first pull request was for a travel website where I added a reset function to the contact page. Earning those **10 points** and seeing my name on the leaderboard was exhilarating.

As I delved deeper, I discovered that contributors who scored **60 points** would receive a certificate of participation. This goal motivated me to contribute regularly. With each pull request, my score grew, and I earned badges. Each new badge made me think, "I can go for one more." This cycle of small achievements kept me going. Have you ever felt that rush of excitement when you accomplish something you didn’t think you could? That’s exactly how I felt each time.

There were moments of frustration when I couldn’t fulfill or raise an issue due to a lack of skills. Knowing what needed to be done but being unable to contribute was disheartening. In those moments, I reminded myself that I would skill up for the next open-source program. Have you ever faced a challenge that made you promise to do better next time? I am committed to continuous learning and growth until I reach my expectations.

Solving level 3 issues, the highest point issues, brought immense happiness. Despite the mix of emotions, I never stopped. I even motivated my friends to join and experience the journey.

Out of **27,000+ registrations** and **17,000+ participants**, ranking in top **25** is a significant achievement for me. This journey has been incredibly rewarding. From having zero knowledge to becoming a top 25 contributor, I’ve learned so much and grown both personally and professionally. It proves that with dedication and consistency, even the most intimidating challenges can be overcome. If I can do it, so can you.

This experience has taught me the power of perseverance and the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone. It has been a journey of growth, learning, and self-discovery. I hope my story inspires you to take that leap of faith and embark on your own journey. Remember, every great achievement begins with the decision to try.
